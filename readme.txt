== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Are Free accounts available? =
Absolutely! One of the levels of accounts is Free.
= Is your Free account a trial only? =
Nope, use your free account for as long as you would like.
= How long does it take to get chat working on my site? =
Normally, someone can go from 0 to completely set up within 5-10 minutes. This includes installing this plugin, signing up for your free or paid account and getting chat online on your site. We do not include additional customization in this time estimate because it is not required to have a fully functional chat widget on your site.
